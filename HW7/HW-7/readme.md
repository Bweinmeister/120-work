# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

This code initially is designed to setup variables and parameters to define
where an ellipse will move around the canvas.
The first section of the code defines the variables that will dictate the
parameters of the ball.
The second function defines the canvas and sets up the background.
In the draw function portion of the code it goes through a series of Boolean
statements that dictate the trajectory of the balls path through width and
height statements. the last line of code in that function defines the fill
and uses the variables defined earlier to create an ellipse.
The final function of the code defines a mouse pressed function that whenever
the mouse is pressed the balls scale changes and the ball seemingly becomes
faster.



## How did you alter the sketch?

I altered the sketch by changing the mouse pressed function to include two
details. The first was to change the background to a random green color when
the mouse is pressed. The second was to change the color of the ellipse to a
random blue color when the mouse is pressed.
