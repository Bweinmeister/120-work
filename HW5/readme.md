  During this homework cycle I learned a lot about animation, formatting, and scopes. Each of these seemed like they would be very helpful in my future coding endeavors. When I was working on this assignment I had trouble with the core concepts at first, but started to understand animation over time. I would like to learn more about animation in general during the class, this seemed like a complex concept and it will take me some time to master.
