Final Project

For my final project proposal I left the door wide open for ideas and
wiggle room. This was sort of a double edged sword. I had a basic idea of
what I wanted to do after looking through some of the example projects
and decided to learn how to load an image and using a png coupled with a
mouse pressed function to add some effects to my background image. learning
to upload an image for the background of my project was a lot of work, and very
challenging. I mentioned in my proposal that I wanted to showcase what I have
learned in the course. I am definitely not the best coder in the class however,
I believe that my project showcases some of the skills that I have gained from
the course as a whole and I am proud of the challenges that I tackled and
overcame. I struggled a lot with getting a jpeg to load as the background. I had
to learn how to use new functions such as the preload function. I watched
several tutorials and learned several ways to upload an image. I used a package
to start a server and host my image file. All in all there were many obstacles
but I am satisfied with my final project.
