This week there was a lot that I learned. I fund that taking a proactive approach to this weeks assignment was helpful in the completion of this process. Since I am still new to working with code and github I found it was easiest for me to go at a slow consistent pace. I haven't been able to be much help to fellow classmates as of yet because I feel that I am still in a beginners phase. When working on this assignment I was still getting used to github and it was a struggle to get everything posted.
