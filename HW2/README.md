2. Did you have any problems or issues?
- How did you solve these?
- Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker?
- Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
3. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
4. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

##Answers to the weekly questions

1. In this homework cycle we took a look at creating repositories and downloading tools for text editors. To tackle this assignment I went step by step paying close attention to the details and making sure I was absorbing all of the content
2. I did not have any problems other than getting initially oriented.
- I am having trouble with remembering some of the terminology for some of the applications
- There has not been any class feedback so far and I have not asked many questions
3. There is nothing in particular I would like to discuss further
4. With the past homework cycle there was no class issues to address and therefore I felt that it was unnecessary to help my fellow classmates
