For this assignment it was a nice break from the usual pace for assignments and
I will use this time to get better at some skills. Looping is a very useful
skill to learn and I am happy that we got to learn about it this week. For this
week I didn't find it necessary to check the forums for help with my questions
since their weren't too many of them to check for.
