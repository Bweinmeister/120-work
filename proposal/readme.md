In my final project it is my plan to create a surreal landscape with independently moving particles. There are many of the examples that took this idea and used it in more detail to create a game.  I think that these are great ideas however I think that sticking to the deadline for the project it might be hard for me to tame such a feat due to schedule. There Iâ€™m sure will be problems with trying to accomplish this goal, however I feel that if I plan accordingly and stick to my deadline plan I think that I will be able to achieve a satisfactory product. Some of these problems that I can see arising might be with some of the of the particles themselves. These have been problems for me in the past with these effects, but I believe that taking care of these problems will be critical to proving that my final project is an extension of what I learned. Some work that I have completed so far on the project is trying to brush up on my skills regarding particles and independently moving options and their functions. I have also done some research into landscapes that I think might be beneficial to my final projects overall theme.
