In this homework cycle I had a lot of trouble with completing the assignment. In order to complete the assignment I had to look over both examples and go back and re-read many of the sections several times. I did my best to keep my sketch organized and consulted a few outside websites for problems that I got stuck with. When I got stuck I went through the material slower and made sure to take my time. I decided not to post my issues to the class website due to the fact that they were mostly just about learning the material for the first time and really just took some time to master. I think something I would enjoy learning how to do in the future is the ability to flip a shape and not just rotate it. Since I had a hard time with the material this week I didn't get a chance to help fellow classmates with their questions, as I had not fully mastered the concepts.
