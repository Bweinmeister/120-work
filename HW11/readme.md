This week I had trouble understanding the concepts and had to rely on the forums
and the examples for help. I understand the concept of moving objects, however
I had problems with implementing these techniques myself. I think my final
product turned out well and showcased that I knew the concept. I went to the
forums for help this week however I did not feel as if I had understanding
enough to help my fellow classmates. All in all I feel as if I understand
the concepts of this week well.
